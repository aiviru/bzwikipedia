This TODO list just covers what's broken or needs implementing in the wiki to
html converter.

* The rest of the raw HTML tags.

* There can be markup within markup. [[.. '''...''']].

* Wiki tables: {| ... | ... | ... |- ... | ... |- ... |}

* List fixing: It gets a little broken when it's followed by a nested tag.
  (Usually a {{ ... template }})

* Image: tags for images. (They're broken, but we may support a local image
  mirror at some point)

* Templates:
  These will account for probably most of the work, but will go a long
  way towards looking good.

** Make an effort to at least hide behavior switches
   Many of these are relatively ignorable.

** Implement <noinlude>, <includeonly>, <onlyinclude>

** Start interpreting and implementing variables

** Implement at least the core set of parser functions

** Start actually inluding pages.

*** This'll quickly need parameter support to be useful.

*** This probably warrants some degree of caching because includes can go
    pretty deep. Though at least cache never invalidates until a new
    dump is imported.

Future:

* Idea: Turn (e.g: relative to wikipedia) image links into "Download this and
  save it locally", which triggers a wget and bzwikipedia saves and indexes
  it locally, then references it in the future.
