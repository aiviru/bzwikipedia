This TODO list just covers what's broken or needs implementing in the wiki to
html converter.

* The rest of the raw HTML tags.

* There can be markup within markup. [[.. '''...''']].

* Wiki tables: {| ... | ... | ... |- ... | ... |- ... |}

* List fixing: It gets a little broken when it's followed by a nested tag.
  (Usually a {{ ... template }})

* Image: tags for images. (They're broken, but we may support a local image
  mirror at some point)

Template list:

* cite journal, cite web, cite book

* infobox

* multiple image (From Ruby?raw=1)

* convert (From Ruby?raw=1)

* commons category

* Jewellery (From Ruby?raw=1)

* reflist|colwidth

* about

Future:

* Idea: Turn (e.g: relative to wikipedia) image links into "Download this and
  save it locally", which triggers a wget and bzwikipedia saves and indexes
  it locally, then references it in the future.
